# Authenticode signing of the Windows binaries

The Windows release binaries can be signed with Authenticode through Microsoft Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing), Basic plan, in the maintainer's personal Azure subscription. Signing runs inside the `package-windows` job of `.github/workflows/release-build.yml` with OIDC federation: no signing secret is stored anywhere. Whether a release is signed is chosen per release with `release/release.sh <tag> --windows-signing=on|off`; the flag is required.

The workflow signs with `Azure/artifact-signing-action`, the renamed `azure/trusted-signing-action`; the workflow pins the commit by SHA (`release/check-pins.sh` enforces that for every action).

This is the same arrangement agentbus 1.x uses, set up separately for `ericfitz/agentbus2`: the federated credential names this repository, and the repository variables below are set on this repository.

## Cost

Basic plan: $9.99 per month for up to 5,000 signatures, billed per account per month, not prorated, and it cannot be paused. Deleting the account is the only way to stop billing, and it discards the identity validation.

## One-time setup

1. In the Azure subscription: first register the `Microsoft.CodeSigning` resource provider in the subscription, then create an Artifact Signing account (Basic), complete individual identity validation (the validation email link expires after 7 days), and create a Public Trust certificate profile. The signer name on the certificate is the validated individual identity. Per Microsoft's quickstart:
   - The *Artifact Signing Identity Verifier* role is needed to create the identity validation.
   - Individual validation comes from the Azure billing account (Account Type Individual, matching the government ID).
   - The validated name becomes the certificate's common name, which is the value of `AUTHENTICODE_SIGNER`; read it from the certificate profile's Certificate subject preview.
2. Register an Entra application with a federated credential whose subject is `repo:ericfitz/agentbus2:environment:release` (issuer `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, audience `api://AzureADTokenExchange`), so only jobs in this repository's `release` environment can obtain a token. Assign it the *Artifact Signing Certificate Profile Signer* role on that certificate profile only. An application registered for v1 can carry a second federated credential for this subject.
3. In the repository, add a `v*` tag rule to the `release` environment (Settings > Environments > release > Deployment branches and tags > tag pattern `v*`, creating the environment there if absent), so only tags matching `v*` can deploy to it. `release.sh` dispatches the workflow on the tag itself (`gh workflow run --ref <tag>`), so the run's `github.ref` is the tag and the rule admits it. The `package-windows` job uses this environment for both `on` and `off` releases.
4. Store these as repository **variables** (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables), not secrets; none of them grants access on its own:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | the Entra application's client id |
   | `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | the tenant id |
   | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | the subscription id |
   | `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_ENDPOINT` | the account's regional endpoint, for example `https://eus.codesigning.azure.net/` |
   | `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_ACCOUNT` | the Artifact Signing account name |
   | `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_PROFILE` | the certificate profile name |
   | `AUTHENTICODE_SIGNER` | the certificate's common name only (what `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` reports as the signer's simple name), not the full subject |

`release.sh --windows-signing=on` checks that all seven exist (`gh variable list`) before building anything, and names the missing ones. The workflow checks them again. `gh variable list --repo ericfitz/agentbus2` shows what is set.

## Releasing

- `--windows-signing=on`: `package-windows` signs both executables (file digest SHA-256, timestamped by `http://timestamp.acs.microsoft.com` with SHA-256), verifies each signature's status, signer common name and timestamp countersignature, runs the signed amd64 binary, and only then are the zips attested and listed in `SHA256SUMS`. A failure in that job (lapsed subscription, expired validation, missing role or variable) fails the workflow; `release.sh` stops with the run URL and the draft stays for a rerun. Nothing is published unsigned when `on` was chosen.
- `--windows-signing=off`: no Azure step runs, and `release.sh` ends the release notes with: "The Windows binaries in this release are not Authenticode-signed; they are covered by the signed SHA256SUMS and by build attestations." (`release/notes-vX.Y.Z.md` never holds that line.)
- A rerun before publishing may change the choice (for example `off` after a lapsed subscription); every Windows asset is replaced and the notes line is added or removed to match. Do not flip the choice after publishing: a rerun then replaces the public zips and `SHA256SUMS`, and winget is not refreshed.

## Pausing and resuming

Pausing: delete the Artifact Signing account. Billing stops; the identity validation and the certificate profile are lost. Releases continue with `--windows-signing=off`.

Resuming: repeat setup step 1 (identity validation takes days), reassign the role in step 2 to the new certificate profile, and update the `ARTIFACT_SIGNING_*` variables. The workflow is unchanged either way.

## Checking a release

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\agentbus2.exe | Format-List Status, SignerCertificate, TimeStamperCertificate
```

`Status` is `Valid` and the signer's subject names the maintainer. An unsigned release says so in its notes; its binaries are still covered by the signed `SHA256SUMS` and the build attestations.
